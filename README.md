# Dots_and_Boxes
The classic game of Dots and Boxes

Usually two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1 box earns one point and takes another turn. A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial.

There are many different game play modes that are included that simulate different aggressions and game styles of play
